A chemical formula is a format used to express the structure of atoms.

## Molecular Geometry and Structural Formula
[[_Isomer|Isomers]] are compounds in which two molecules can have the same number of atoms, and thus the same molecular formula, but can have completely different physical and chemical properties because of their differences in structural formula.

### Polymers
A [[_polymer|Polymer]] is formed when small molecules of identical structure, monomers, combine into a large cluster. The monomers are joined together by [[_covalent bonds|covale]].
