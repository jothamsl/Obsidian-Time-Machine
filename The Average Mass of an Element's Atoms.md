The subscripts in chemical formulas, and the coefficients in chemical equations represent exact quantities. $\ce{H2O}$, for example, indicates that a water molecule comprises exactly two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.

## Average Atomic Mass
The mass of any given atom is **not** simply the sum of the masses of its electrons, protons and neutrons.
