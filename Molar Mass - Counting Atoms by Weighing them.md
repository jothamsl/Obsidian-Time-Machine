> ### **Abstract:** In this note we explain the concept of the Molar mass, Avagadro's number, the Mole, Molecular weight and Molar volume.

## Counting Atoms: Avogadro's Numbere
Avogadro's number is known as:
$$N_A\approx6.02\times10^{23}$$
So $N_A\approx6.02\times10^{23}$ of what? Well, of anything you like: apples, stars in the sky, burritos. However, the only practical use for $N_A$ is to have a more convenient way of expressing the huge numbers of the tiny particles such as atoms or molecules that we deal with in chemistry. Avogadro's number is a [[_collective number|collective number]], just like a dozen.

## Moles and their uses
The mole (abbreviated mol) is the SI measure of the quantity of a chemical "entity", which can be an atom, molecule, formula unit, electron or photon.
One mole of anything is just Avogadro's number of that something.

> The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in $0.012$ kilograms of carbon-12.

## Molar Mass
The atomic weight, molecular weight, or formula weight of one mole of the [[_fundamental unit|fundamental units]] (atoms, molecules or groups of atoms that correspond to the formula of a pure substance) is the ratio of its mass to $1/12$ the mass of one mole of $C^{12}$, and being a ratio, is dimensionless. But at the same time, this [[_molar mass|molar mass]] (as many now prefer to call it) is also the observable mass of one mole ($N_A$) of the substance, so we frequently emphasize this by stating it explicitly as so many grams (or kilograms) per mole: $g/mol^{-1}$

NOTE: The mole is a number not a mass.
