The first and simplest carboxylic acid, *formic acid* ($\ce{HCOOH}$), was first obtained by the distillation of ants.

The next higher [[_homolog|homolog]] is *acetic acid* ($\ce{CH3COOH}$) which is made by fermenting cider and honey in the presence of oxygen.

The third homolog, *propionic acid* ($\ce{CH3CH2COOH}$), is seldom encountered in everyday life.

The fourth homolog, *butyric acid* ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2COOH}$), is one of the most foul-smelling substances imaginable.

The acid with the carboxyl group attached directly to a benzene ring is called benzoic acide
