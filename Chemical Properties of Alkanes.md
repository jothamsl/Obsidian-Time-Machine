> ### **Abstract:**

[[_Alkane|Alkane]] molecules are [[_non-polar|non-polar]] and therefore generally do not react with [[_ionic compounds|ionic compounds]] like most liboratory acids, bases, oxidizing agents, or reducing agents. Consider butane as an example:

$$\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH3 + OH- -> no reaction}$$
$$\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH3 + H+ -> no reaction}$$
$$\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH3 + MnO4- -> no reaction}$$
