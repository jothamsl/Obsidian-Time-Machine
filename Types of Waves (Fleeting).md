# Types of Waves (Fleeting)
Created: 02-11-2021 16:05

A wave is a disturbance that travels or propagates from the place where it was created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass.

## Mechanical Waves
Mechanical waves are waves which require a medium to travel through in order for energy to be transferred. e.g water.

The speed of a wave depends on the material properties of the medium through which it travels.
