> ### **Abstract:**

[[_direct current|Direct Current]] (d.c) is the flow of electric charge in only one direction. It is a steady state of a constant-voltage circuit.

[[_alternating current|Alternating Current]] (a.c) is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction. It is produced by an alternating [[_emf|emf]] (electromotive force).

In an a.c circuit, voltage fluctuates sinusoidally with time at a fixed frequency. Therefore, the a.c voltage, or the "voltage at a plug" can be given by:

$$v=V_0\ \sin(\omega t)$$
Where $v$ is the voltage at time $t$, $V_0$ is the [[_peak voltage|peak voltage]], and $\omega$ is the [[_angular frequency|angular frequency]] in radians per second. 

For a simple resistance circuit, $I=V/R$, so the a.c current, meaning the current that fluctuates sinusoidally with time at a fixed frequency is:

$$i=I_0\sin(\omega t)$$

Where $i$ is the current at time $t$ and $I_0$ is the peak current and is equal to $V_0/R$
