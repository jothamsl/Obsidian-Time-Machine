# ‚ö°Ô∏è Electric Field
Created: 2021-10-22 10:17

A [[_Field|field]] is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the [[üí® Force]] that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection.

[[Michael Faraday]], an English physicist of the nineteenth century, proposed the concept of an [[_Electric Field|electric field]].

An electric field is generated by electric charges and tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a [[_charge distribution|Charge distribution]].

The electric field extends into space around the charge distribution. A [[Test charge]] is a positive electric charge whose charge is so small that it does not significantly disturb the charges that create the electric field. The force exerted on the test charge is proportional to the charge of the test charge. 

Mathematically, an electric Field is the force (considering only [[_electric force|Electric forces]]) per unit charge:

$$
E=\frac{F}{q_{test}}
$$

Where $F$ is the force of the electric field, and $q_{test}$ is the test charge.

Note that the electric field is a [[_Vector|vector]] field that points in the same direction as the force on the positive test charge. The units of an electric field are $N/C$.
 
If the [[_Field|field]] is created by a [[_point charge|point charge]] or a sphere of [[Uniform charge]], then the magnitude of the force between this point charge $Q$ and the test charge is given by [[_coulomb's law|Coulomb's law]]:

$$
F=k\frac{|Q\cdot q_{test}|}{r^2}
$$

The absolute value is used, because we only consider the magnitude of the [[üí® Force]]. The magnitude of the electric field created by a point charge $Q$ is then:

$$
E=\frac{F}{q_{test}}=\frac{k|Q|}{r^2}
$$

The distance $r$ in the denominator is the distance from the point charge, $Q$, or from the center of a spherical charge, to the point of interest.

Electric field lines point towards or away from the [[_Charge]], depending on the type of charge. Positive charges have electric field lines which point away from them while Negative charges have Electric field lines which point towards them. If we place the positive [[Test charge]] in the electric field of a negative charge, it is attracted to the Negative charge. This is true for negative test charges. This is consistent with [[Coulomb's law]]

Can you tell which charge is positive and which is negative?

The red point on the left carries a charge of $+1NC$, and the blue point on the right carries a charge of $-1NC$. The field lines are denser as you approach the point charge.

The electric field equation says that the electric field gets stronger as we approach the charge that generates it.

An [[_Electric Field]] formed due to multiple charges may be found by adding the electric field from each individual charge. Because this sum can only be a single number, we know that only a single electric-field line can go through any given point. In other words, electric field lines cannot cross each other.
