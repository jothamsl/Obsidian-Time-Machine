> ### **Abstract:**
> The forces between electrically charged particles are used in technologies such as printers, pollution filters, and spray guns used for painting cars and trucks. Static electricity is the study of [[_Phenomena|phenomena]], that involve an imbalance of electrical charge. The study of charge in motion is called [[_Electromagnetism|electromagnetism]]. In this section, we'll ask the questions: What is an electrical charge, how is it associated with objects, and what forces does it create?
