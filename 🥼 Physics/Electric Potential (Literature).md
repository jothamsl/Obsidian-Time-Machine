A [[_Mass]] in a [[Gravitational Field]] has [[Potential Energy]], which means it has the potential to accelerate and thereby increase it's [[Kinetic Energy]]. The [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] is the work that a [[Mass]] can potentially do by virtue of its position in a [[Gravitational Field]].

[[Electric Potential Energy]] works much the same way, but is based on the [[Electric Field]] instead of the [[Gravitational Field]]. By virtue of its position in a an Electric Field, a [[Charge]] has an electric potential energy which is converted to [[Kinetic Energy]]
