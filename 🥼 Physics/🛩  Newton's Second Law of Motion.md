**Newton's second law of motion** states the following:

> * The net external force ([[ðŸ’¨ Force#^573912]]) acting on an object is responsible for the acceleration of the object.
> * The rate of a change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.

This law essentially describes how force causes changes in motion and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as
$$
	F_{net}=ma\ \ \ or \ \ \ \sum{F} = ma
$$

Where $F_{net}$ (or $\sum f$) is the net external force, $m$ is the mass of the system, and $a$ is the acceleration.

	<summary><b>What is change in motion?</b></summary>
		A change in motion is simply a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred.
</details>

From the equation $F_{net}=ma$, we see that force is directly proportional to both mass an acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.

Rearranging Newton's second law to solve for acceleration. We get:

$$a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}\ \ \ or \ \ \ a=\frac{\sum F}{m} $$

In this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional force, which we write as:

$$a\propto F_{net}$$

**Note:** When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double. When one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number.

It is also clear from the equation $a=F_{net}/m$ that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as 

$$a\propto \frac{1}{m}$$

**Note:** Inversely proportional means that if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable must be divided (or multiplied by the reciprocal) by the same number. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia [[ðŸ¥¼ Newton's First Law#^a39e9f]]), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force.

## Applying Newton's Second Law
The Si unit of force is **Newtons**. This is the force needed to accelerate a $1kg$ system at the rate of $1\ m/s^2$. That is, because $F_{net}=ma$, we have:

$$1N=1kg\times 1m/s^2 = 1\frac{Kg\times m}{s^2}$$

Weight can be represented by a vector because it has a direction.
Consider an object with mass $m$ falling towards Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity, which is represented by $W$. Because the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force, we have $F_{net}=W$. We know the acceleration due to gravity of an object is $g$, so we have $a=g$. Substituting these two expressions into Newton's second law gives:
$$ W=mg$$

This is the equation for weight - the gravitational force on a mass $m$. On Earth, $g-9.80m/s^2$, so the weight (disregarding for now the direction of the weight) of a 1.0-kg object on Earth is:

$$W=mg=(1.0kg)(9.80\ m/s^2)=9.8N$$

Recall that although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative value, depending on what the positive direction is in your chosen coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. When the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomes  $g = âˆ’9.8 m/s^2$.

When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in free-fall. In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in free-fall because there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat).

Gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth. Weight varies dramatically away from Earthâ€™s surface. On the moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only $1.67 m/s^2$. Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a $1.0kg$ mass weighs $9.8 N$ on Earth and only about $1.7 N$ on the moon.

	<summary><b>What is the difference between Weight and Mass?</b></summary>
		Weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to the force of gravity while Mass is the amount of matter present in a body.

**Note:** Only net external forces impact the acceleration of an object.
