> ### **Abstract:**
> Electric power is delivered to our homes by [[_alternating current|alternating current]] (ac) through high-voltage transmission lines. [[_transformer|Transformers]] can then change the amplitude of the alternating [[_potential difference|potential difference]] to a more useful form. This lets us transmit power at very high voltages, minimizing resistive heating losses in the lines. Because constant potential differences are unaffected by transformers, this capability is more difficult to achieve with direct-current transmission.
