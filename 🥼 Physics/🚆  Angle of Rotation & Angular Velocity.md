**Rotational motion** is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. **Circular motion** is when an object moves in a circular path, e.g a race-car speeding around a circular curve. **Spin** is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis.

The **Arc length**, is the distance traveled along a circular path. The **radius of curvature**, $r$, is the radius of the circular path.

The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of rotation $\Delta\theta$ is the arc length divided by the radius of the curvature.

$$\Delta\theta = \frac{\Delta s}{r}$$

**Angular Speed ** ($\omega$) is the angular version of linear velocity $v$.  **Tangential velocity** is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion. Consider a line from the center of a CD to its edge, in a given time, each pit (used to record information) on this line moves through the same angle. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider the pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length $\Delta s$ in a short time $\Delta t$. So, its tangential speed is:

$$v=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$

From the definition of the angle of rotation, $\Delta \theta=\frac{\Delta s}{r}$, we see that $\Delta s = r\Delta\theta$. Substituting this into the expression for $v$ gives:

$$v=\frac{r\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=r\omega$$

The equation $v=r\omega$ says that the tangential speed $v$ is proportional to the distance from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is great for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with a larger $r$) than for a point closer to the center of the CD (with smaller $r$).
This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points would still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation.
