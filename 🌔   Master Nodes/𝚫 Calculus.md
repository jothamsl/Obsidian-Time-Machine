# âˆž Calculus

> ### Abstract:
> Calculus is the branch of [[_Mathematics]] which revolves around the idea and concept of infinitesimal change. It has two major branches: [[Differential Calculus]] and [[Integral Calculus]]. The former concerns instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves while integral calculus involves the accumulation of quantities.
