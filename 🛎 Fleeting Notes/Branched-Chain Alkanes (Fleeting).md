* Bending a chain does not change the identity of the compound. e.g all of the following represent the same compound butane:

* Unlike $\ce{C4H10}$ and above, methane, ethane and propane do not exist in isomeric forms because there is only one way to arrange the atoms in each formula so that each carbon atom has four bonds.
* A continuous (unbranched) chain of carbon atoms is often called a [[_straight chain|straight chain]] even though the tetrahedral arrangement about each carbon gives it a zigzag shape.
* Straight chain [[_Alkane|alkanes]] are sometimes called [[_normal alkanes|normal alkanes]].
