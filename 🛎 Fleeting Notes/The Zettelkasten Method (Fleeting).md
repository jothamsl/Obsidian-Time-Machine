## Fleeting Notes

Fleeting notes must meet up with at least one of the following criteria:
* Help you remember the ideas permanently.
* Help you use the idea in you work (e.g a blog, a book)

For each idea that helps achieve at least one of the criteria, write a phrase that will trigger the full idea in your head. e.g

## Literature Notes
At the end of the day or sooner, go to your fleeting notes and:

* Pick out the ideas from your fleeting notes that you really want to keep.
* Elaborate those reminders of those ideas into a paragraph that describes the idea in full. Really try to write this in your own words, don't reference the original document or book. If you;r really stumped, make it up, just complete the idea and move on.

There are five criteria that would be beneficial to your literature notes:
1. Write it in your own words.
2. Write it in such a way that if you read it in 10 years, it would still make sense.
3. One idea per note. If you need to define a term for the idea/concept to make sense. create a term definition card (or linked note in obsidian).
4. Include the complete reference from the source you got the idea from.
5. Include relevant citation (last name, year, pp.22).

## Permanent Notes
Differences between Permanent and literature notes:
* Literature notes are written in the context of the source they were inspired by. While permanent notes are written in the context of your own ideas and interests.
* Literature notes only have one connection, to the book or article from which they emanate from. While permanent notes can have many connections (to individual notes, as part of multiple topics etc)
