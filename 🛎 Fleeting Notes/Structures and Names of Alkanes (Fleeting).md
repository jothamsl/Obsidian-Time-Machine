* [[_Hydrocarbons]] are distinguished by the types of carbon atoms and the properties that result from that bonding.
* [[_Hydrocarbons]] with only carbon-to-carbon single bonds (C-C) and existing as a continuous chain of [[Carbon]] atoms also bonded to [[Hydrogen]] atoms are called alkanes([[_Alkane]]) or [[_saturated hydrocarbons]]. 
* The word saturated has the same meaning for hydrocarbons as it does for the dietary fats and oils: the molecule has no carbon-to-carbon double bonds (C=C).
* Methane has a tetrahedral shape that chemists often portray with wedges indicating bonds coming out towards you and dashed lines indicating bonds that go way back away from you. An ordinary solid line indicates a bond in the plane of the page. Recall that the [[_VSEPR theory]] correctly predicts a tetrahedral shape for the methane molecule.
