* The idea behind taking notes is to have quick access to lots of relevant information (not how best to take notes..).
* The quickest access is to keep the information in our brain.

## Tasks
* **Task 1:** Figure out how to help ourselves remember stuff better.
	1. Think about it often
	2. Link it to other things!
* **Task 2:** Figure out how to organize the information outside our brain so it can be accessed as quickly as possible.

> #### Questions come up in real time.
