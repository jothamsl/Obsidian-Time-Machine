# Halogenated Hydrocarbons
Created: 2021-10-23 11:24

* [[Alkanes]] react with [[Halogens]] to produce [[Halogenated Hydrocarbons]].
* Compounds which the [[Carbon]] atoms are joined in a ring or cyclic fashion are called [[Cycloalkanes]].
* The replacement of only one hydrogen atom, gives an [[Alkyl halide]](or [[Halo-alkane]]).
* The common names of alkyl halides consist of two parts:
	1. The name of the [[Alkyl]] group +
	2. The stem of the name of the halogen with the suffix '-ide'. 
* The [[IUPAC]] naming system for alkyl halides consists of 3 parts:
	1. The number indicating the substituent's location + 
	2. a prefix indicating the halogen [[Substituents]] (The prefix are of the form: *fluoro-*, *chloro-*, *bromo*) +  
	3. The name of the [[Parent Alkane]].
	e.g $\ce{CH3CH2CH2Br}$ has the common name: *propyl bromide* and the IUPAC name: *1-bromopropane*.
* Alkyl halides with [[Simple alkyl groups]] (one to four carbon atoms) are often called by their common names. Those with a larger number of carbon atoms are usually given IUPAC names.
