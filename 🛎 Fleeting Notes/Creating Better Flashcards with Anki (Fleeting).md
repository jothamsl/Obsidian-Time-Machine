## Does Making Anki Flashcards Really "Take Too Long"?
Many people tend to approach their studying in what is called a **Time Debt mindset** - they try to "study faster", even if it costs them a lot of time in the future.

Specifically, they "study more efficiently" but in the end, they create **much bigger time wasters**. These time-wasters are:
1. Getting blanked out because your cards are too vague.
2. Having to re-learn a prerequisite material you've already studied before.
3. Re-taking a course because you failed to remember stuff when it matters most.
4. Not graduating in time.

When you adopt a Time Asset mindset, you end up doing what needs to be done NOW -- even if it initially takes more time -- because that will save you a lot more time in the future.
 
Thus, the more thought you initially spend into creating a flashcard, the long it remains useful and the more rewards you'll be able to reap from it.

So how do better flashcards help you save more time?

By eliminating the **much bigger causes of waste:**
1. They time you're stuck answering incredibly vague cards.
2. The time spent in having to re-learn a prerequisite material because you "life hacked" your way to memorizing lecture slides; 
3. The time spent re-taking a big exam just because you failed to remember important knowledge until the end.

## 3 Principles for Effective Anki Flashcards

As you apply these principles for the first time, you should expect that it'd take you a long time. But of course, as you practice them, you'll get faster and faster. By then, your anki skills should have developed.

### Principle 1: Atomic
Atomic means (ideally) cueing one idea per card, usually done in two ways:

1. **Increased specificity:** Breaking a complex idea into multiple specific ones and creating cards for each. (easiest).=
2. **Increased integration:** Condensing multiple ideas into a single, higher-level idea. (hardest -- needs synthesis and patter recognition)

The primary purpose of this is to avoid what psychologists call [[_cue overload|cue overload]]. When you use cues that have more than one associated memory, it tends to impede recall rather than help it. Your cue then, becomes almost useless to help you recall a specific detail. 

For example, if you were asked "What are the white-colored items in your bedroom?" as compared to "think of white-colored objects"...

Then you'll be able to answer the former in less time because there's more cue overload in the latter.

Don't use anki for lists greater than 4 items, unless:
1. They're highly related to each other; or 
2. Can be remembered with a single mnemonic -- just use memory techniques rather than cloze overlap

### Principle 2: Holistic
*Holistic* means associating/integrating an idea into your existing knowledge first before putting into Anki.
