Carboxylic acids occur widely in nature, often with alcohols or other [[_functional group|functional groups]], as in fats and oils, and waxes. They are components of many foods, medicines and household products.

The first and simplest carboxylic acid, *formic acid* ($\ce{HCOOH}$), was first obtained by the distillation of ants.

The next higher [[_homolog|homolog]] is *acetic acid* ($\ce{CH3COOH}$) which is made by fermenting cider and honey in the presence of oxygen.

The third homolog, *propionic acid* ($\ce{CH3CH2COOH}$), is seldom encountered in everyday life.

The fourth homolog, *butyric acid* ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2COOH}$), is one of the most foul-smelling substances imaginable.

The acid with the carboxyl group attached directly to a benzene ring is called *benzoic acid* ($\ce{C6H5COOH}$)

The common names of carboxylic acids use Greek letters ($\alpha$, $\beta$ e.tc), not numbers, to designate the position of substituent groups in acids. These letters refer to the position of the carbon atom in relation to the carboxyl carbon atom.

## [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]] nomenclature of carboxylic acids
In the nomenclature system of the [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]], the parent [[_Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon]] is the one that corresponds to the longest continuous chain ([[_LCC|LCC]]).
* The *-e* ending of the parent [[_Alkane|alkane]] is replaced by the suffix *-oic* and the word acid. E.g, the carboxylic acid derived from pentane is pentanoic acid ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH}$). As with aldehydes, the carboxyl carbon atom is counted first, numbers are used to indicate any substituted carbon atoms in the parent chain.

> Greek letters are used with common names; numbers are used with IUPAC names.
