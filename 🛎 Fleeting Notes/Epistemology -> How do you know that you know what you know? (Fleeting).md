> *There is no definite way to confirm that we know anything at all. Only from our direct experience can we claim any knowledge about the world.*

### The role of perception in knowledge
* Can we really trust our senses of perception?

> *Surely whatever I had admitted until now as most true I received from the senses or through the senses. However, I have noticed that the senses are sometimes deceptive; and it is a mark of prudence never to place our complete trust in those who have deceived us even once.*
* [[_Descartes|Descartes]] famously employed systematic doubt, questioning all knowledge conveyed by his experience in the world until the only knowledge he couldn't doubt was the fact that he could doubt.

> *Therefore I suppose that everything I see is false. I believe that none of what my deceitful memory represents ever existed. I have no sense whatever. Body, shape, extension, movement and place are all chimeras. What then will be true? ... Thus, after everything has been most carefully weighed, it must finally be established that this pronouncement "I am, I exist" is necessarily true every time I utter it or conceive it in my mind. (Descartes, Meditations)*
* Descartes confirmed we have a self. Unfortunately this self could be the one we see in the mirror each morning or a [[_brain in a vat|brain in a vat]]. If the only thing we cannot doubt is that we can doubt, essentially that guarantees us having only the mechanism to doubt. No body. We could therefore be isolated brains, being manipulated by things unknown, our entire world a mirage.

### How then can we hope to claim knowledge about the physical world?
* For [[_John Locke|John Locke]], **our understanding of the world comes from our experience of it**.
* He wrote that there were two types of qualities, one that existed innately in an object or series of objects, such as size, number or motion, and those that are wholly dependent on our perception of them, such as color or smell.


> *The particular bulk, number, figure, and motion of the parts of fire or snow are really in them, whether oneâ€™s senses perceive them or no: and therefore they may be called real qualities, because they really exist in those bodies. But light, heat, whiteness, or coldness are not more really in them than sickness or pain is in manna. (Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding)*
* Because our knowledge of the world comes from our perception of it, it is impossible to conclusively know the existence of anything independent of our perception. Berkeley, wrote:
> *Hence, as it is impossible for me to see or feel anything without an actual sensation of that thing, so it is impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it.*
* What these philosophies can be useful for understanding though, is that often **what we consider knowledge is more of a general social agreement on a somewhat consistent comprehension of the things before us.**
