* One common theme you'll find throughout each point is that every time you make an experienced reader have to think to follow your solution, you lose.
* It is far better to prove too much too clearly than to prove too little.

## Have a Plan
* Your goal in writing a clear solution is to prevent the reader from having to think. You must express your ideas clearly and concisely. 
* Make a simple outline of your solution. 
* Include the items you'll need to define, and the order in which you will write up the important parts of your solution.
* The outline will help ensure that you don't skip anything and that you put your steps in an order that's easy to follow.
