# Condensed Structural and Line-Angle Formulas

* A [[_Molecular Formula]] shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a [[_Molecule]]. 
* A [[_Structural Formula]] shows all the [[Carbon]] and [[Hydrogen]] atoms and the bonds attaching them. Thus, structural formulas identify the specific [[_Isomer]] by showing the order of attachment of the various atoms.

* The ultimate condensed formula is a [[_Line-Angle Formula]], in which [[Carbon]] atoms are implied at the corners and ends of lines, and each carbon atom is understood to be attached to enough [[Hydrogen]] atoms to give each carbon atom four bonds. e.g: we can represent *pentane* ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3}$) and *isopentane* [$\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2CH3}$] as:

* Parentheses in a [[_Condensed Structural Formula]] indicates that the enclosed group of atoms is attached to the adjacent carbon atom
