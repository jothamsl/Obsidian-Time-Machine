# Alcohols - Nomenclature and Classification (Fleeting)
Created: 23-10-2021 18:30

* An alcohol is an organic compound with a [[_hydroxyl]] ($\ce{OH}$) functional group on an [[_aliphatic]] carbon atom.
* They are represented by the general formula $\ce{ROH}$, where $\ce{R}$ is an [[Alkyl]] group.
* Alcohols are common in nature.
* ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages.
* According to the [[_IUPAC]], alcohols are named by changing the ending of the [[_Parent Alkane]] name to *-ol*.  
	* In [[Cyclic Alcohols]], the [[Carbon]] atom bearing the $\ce{OH}$ group is designated as the first in counting the [[_LCC]], but the 1 is not used in the name.
	* [[Substituents]] are named and numbered as in [[Alkanes]].
	* If more than one $\ce{OH}$  appears in the same molecule ([[_Polyhydroxy alcohols]]), suffixes such as *-diol* and *-triol* are used. 
	* In these cases, the *-e* ending of the [[_Parent Alkane]] is retained.

## Classification of Alcohols
* Some of the properties of alcohols depend on the number of [[Carbon]] atoms attached to the specific carbon atom that is attached to the $\ce{OH}$  group. Alcohols can be grouped into three classes on this basis.
