Created: 2021-10-23 17:48

* Functional groups refer to specific atoms bonded in a certain arrangement that gives a compound certain physical and chemical properties.
* They essentially functionalize a compound.
* They undergo the same type of reactions regardless of the compound of which they are a part; however, the presence of certain functional groups within close proximity can limit reactivity. 
* The atoms of a functional group are linked together to the rest of the compound by [[_Covalent bonds]]
