* When a chain contains three or more [[Carbon]] atoms, the atoms can join to form ring or cyclic structures.
* The simplest cyclic hydrocarbon has the formula $\ce{C3H6}$ with each [[Carbon]] atom having two [[Hydrogen]] atoms attached. This cycloalkane is called *cyclopropane*

* Cyclopropane has a boiling point of $-33^{\circ}C$. It is a gas at [[_room temperature]].
* It serves as a quick anesthetic with few undesirable effects in the body. 
* It is no longer used in surgery, because it forms explosive mixtures with air at nearly all concentrations.
* Cyclic hydrocarbons with only single bonds are names by adding the prefix *cyclo-* to the name of the open-chain compound having the same number of carbon atoms as there are in the ring. Thus the name for the cyclic compound $\ce{C4H8}$ is *cyclobutane*. 
* When cyclic hydrocarbons are represented in line angle form, they take the appearance of geometric figures. Each corner of the geometric figure represents a [[Carbon]] atom plus as many [[Hydrogen]] atoms as need to give each carbon atom four bonds.

* Some cyclic compounds have [[_substituent]] groups attached. e.g *ethylcyclopropane*: ![[Screen Shot 2021-10-26 at 5.04.43 AM.png]]
* The properties of cyclic hydrocarbons are generally quite similar to those of the corresponding open-chain compounds. So cycloalkanes (withe the exception of cyclopropane, which has a highly)
