* When a chain contains three or more [[Carbon|carbon]] atoms, the atoms can join to form ring or cyclic structures.
* The simplest cyclic hydrocarbon has the formula $\ce{C3H6}$ with each [[Carbon|carbon]] atom having two [[Hydrogen]] atoms attached. This cycloalkane is called *cyclopropane*

* Cyclopropane has a boiling point of $-33^{\circ}C$. It is a gas at [[_room temperature|room temperature]].
* It serves as a quick anesthetic with few undesirable effects in the body. 
* It is no longer used in surgery, because it forms explosive mixtures with air at nearly all concentrations.
* Cyclic hydrocarbons with only single bonds are names by adding the prefix *cyclo-* to the name of the open-chain compound having the same number of carbon atoms as there are in the ring. Thus the name for the cyclic compound $\ce{C4H8}$ is *cyclobutane*. 
* When cyclic hydrocarbons are represented in line angle form, they take the appearance of geometric figures. Each corner of the geometric figure represents a [[Carbon|carbon]] atom plus as many [[Hydrogen]] atoms as need to give each carbon atom four bonds.

* Some cyclic compounds have [[_substituent|substituent]] groups attached. e.g *ethylcyclopropane*: ![[Screen Shot 2021-10-26 at 5.04.43 AM.png]]
* The properties of cyclic hydrocarbons are generally quite similar to those of the corresponding open-chain compounds. So cycloalkanes (withe the exception of cyclopropane, which has a highly strained ring) act very much like noncyclic alkanes.
* Cyclic structures containing five or six [[Carbon|carbon]] atoms (cyclopentane, cyclohexane, are particularly stable.
* The *cyclopropane* ring is strained because the $C-C-C$ angles are $60^\circ$, and the preferred (tetrahedral) bond angle is $109.5^\circ$. (This strain is readily evident) when you try to build a [[_ball-and-stick model]] of cyclopropane; *cyclopentane* and *cyclohexane* rings have little strain because the $C-C-C$ angles are near the preferred angles.
