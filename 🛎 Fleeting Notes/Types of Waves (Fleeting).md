# Types of Waves (Fleeting)
Created: 02-11-2021 16:05


*  A **wave** is a disturbance that travels or propagates from the place where it was created.
*  Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. **They don't displace the medium**.
* **Mechanical waves** are waves which require a medium to travel through in order for energy to be transferred. e.g water.
* A **Pulse wave** is a sudden disturbance in which only one wave and a few waves are generated.
* A **Periodic wave** is a wave that repeats the same oscillation for several cycles.
* The highest point of a wave is called a **crest** or **peak** while the lowest point is called a **trough**
* A **Transverse wave** is a wave that propagates so that the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of travel.![[Pasted image 20211210005926.png]]
* A **Longitudinal wave** is a wave whereby the direction of the disturbance is parallel to the direction of travel.
