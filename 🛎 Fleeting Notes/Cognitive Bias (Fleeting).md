A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make. It's a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.

Individuals create their own [[Subjective reality]] from their perception of the input.

It's often a result of the brain's attempt to simplify information processing.
