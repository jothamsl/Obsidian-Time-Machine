* Scientists of the 18th and early 19th centuries studies compounds obtained from plants and animals and labeled them organic because they were isolated from "organized" (living) systems.
* In 1828, German chemist [[_Friedrich Wohler]] synthesized [[_Urea]] from inorganic starting starting materials. He mixed silver cyanate ($\ce{AgOCN}$) and ammonium chloride ($\ce{NH4Cl}$), expecting to get ammonium cyanate ($\ce{NH4OCN}$). But he found the product to be urea:

$$
\ce{AgOCN + NH4Cl->AgCl + NH2CONH2}
$$
* Today, [[_Organic chemistry]] is the study of the chemistry of [[Carbon]] compounds.
