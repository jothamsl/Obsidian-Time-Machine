* The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.
* This approach was used by the philosopher [[Aristotle]] and is now used by Elon Musk.
> "I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way-by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!"
> [[Richard Feynman]]
* A [[_First Principle]] is a foundational [[_Proposition]] or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.
* Aristotle, writing on first principles said:
> In every systematic inquiry ([[_Methodos]]) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary principles all the way to the elements.
* It's one of the best mental models you can use to improve your thinking because the essentials allow you to see where reasoning by [[_Analogy]] might lead you astray.
