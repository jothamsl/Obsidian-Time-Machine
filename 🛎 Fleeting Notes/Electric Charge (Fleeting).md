## Electric Charge

* Electric charge comes in two varieties: 
	* *Positive charges* (+)
	* *Negative charges* (-)
* Like charges repel while unlike charges attract
* The word electric itself comes from the [[_Greek]] word [[_Elektron]] for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw.
* An [[_Electron]] is a particle that is the fundamental unit of negative [[_Electrical Charge]]. A [[_Proton]] is a particle which is the fundamental unit of [[_Positive Charge]]. Each proton carries one unit of positive charge and each electron carries one unit of negative charge.
* The *SI* unit for [[_Electrical Charge]] is the [[_Coulomb]] which is named after the French physicist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]], who studied the force between charged objects. 
* The [[_Proton]] carries $+1.602\times 10^{-19}C$.
* The [[_Electron]] carries $-1.602\times 10^{-19}C$.
* The number $n$ of protons required to make $+1.00C$ is:

$$
n=1.00C\times\frac{1\ proton}{1.602\times 10^{-19}C}=6.25\times 10^{18}
$$

* The same number of electrons is required to make $-1.00C$ of electric charge. 
* The fundamental unit of charge is often represented as $e$. Thus, the charge on a proton is $e$, and the charge on an electron is $-e$. Mathematically, $e=+1.602\times 10^{-19}C$
* American physicist [[_Robert Millikan]](1868-1953) and his student [[_Harvey Fletcher]](1884-1981) were the first to make a relatively accurate measurement of the fundamental unit of charge on the electron. The experiment is know as the [[_Millikan Oil-drop Experiment]]

## Conservation of Charge
* In any [[_System]] involving charges, the [[_Law of Conservation of Charge]] is always in play.
* It tells us that the [[_Net Charge]] in a [[_System]] is the same before and after any interaction within the system, given that no external charge enters the system and that no internal charge leaves the system during the interaction. Mathematically, conservation the law can be represented as:

$$
q_{initial}=q_{final}
$$
Where $q_{initial}$ is the [[_Net Charge]] before interaction and $q_{final}$ is the net charge after the interaction.
## Conductors & Insulators
* If charge can easily move through a material, then the material is know as a [[_Conductor]].
* If charge can't move through a material, then the material is called an [[_Insulator]].
* With enough energy, it is possible to force electrons to move through an [[_Insulator]]. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process.
* The conductivity of some materials is intermediate between conductors and insulators. These are called [[_semiconductors]]. They can be made conductive under the right conditions, which can involve *temperature*, the purity of the material, and the force applied to push electrons through them. 
* [[_semiconductors]] are extensively used in computer chips.
* The most commonly used semiconductor is [[_Silicon]].

* When there is an excess amount of negative charge on a [[_Conductor]], the charges repel each other and are distributed along the surface of the conductor. This is know as [[_Polarization]].


## Transfer & Separation of Charge
* Electric charges can be transferred through several methods:
* **Charging by Contact:** The surfaces of two object made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated.
* **Charging by Conduction:** This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so excess electrons repel from each other as much as possible. e.g A metal sphere with 100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second sphere.

* **Note:** The sense of reasoning applies to the transfer of [[_Positive Charge]]. However, because positive charges essentially cannot move in solids, it is transferred by moving [[_Negative charge]] in the opposite direction. e.g The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere is left with 75 excess protons. The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons.
* **Conduction by Polarization:**
* **Conduction by Induction:** In this case, a charge is create by approaching a charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced
