* The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.
* This approach was used by the philosopher [[Aristotle]] and is now used by Elon Musk.
> "I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way-by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!"
> [[Richard Feynman]]
* A [[_First Principle]] is a foundational [[_proposition]] or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.
* Aristotle, writing on first principles said:
> In every systematic inquiry ([[_methodos]]) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary principles all the way to the elements.
* **The Coach and the Play Stealer**,  **The Cook and the Chef**.
* It's one of the best mental models you can use to improve your thinking because the essentials allow you to see where reasoning by [[_analogy]] might lead you astray.

* If we never learn to take something apart, test the assumptions, and reconstruct it, we end up trapped in what other people tell us -- trapped in the way things have always been done.
* Everything that is not a [[Law of Nature]] is just a [[_Shared belief]]. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.

## Techniques for Establishing First Principles 
### Socratic Questioning
[[_Socratic]] questioning can be used to establish first principles through [[_Stringent analysis]]. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and normal discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. 
Socratic questioning generally follows this process:
1. Clarify your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this?, What exactly do I think?).
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true?, What if I thought the opposite?).
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up?, What are the sources?).
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think?, How do I know I am correct?).
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong?, What are the consequences if I am?).
6. Questioning the original question (Why did I think that?, Was I correct?, What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?).
* This process stop you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses.

* Elon Musk explained his idea and the dilemma of first principles as:
> "I think people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good. But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past."
* His approach to [[Understanding reality]] is to start with what is true -- not with his intuition.
* Start with the principle, rather than the problem at hand.
