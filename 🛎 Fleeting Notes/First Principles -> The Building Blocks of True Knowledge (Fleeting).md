# First Principles -> The Building Blocks of True Knowledge

* The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.
* This approach was used by the philosopher [[Aristotle]] and is now used by Elon Musk.

> [[Richard Feynman]]
* A [[_First Principle]] is a foundational [[_Proposition]] or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.
* Aristotle, writing on first principles said:
> In every systematic inquiry ([[_Methodos]]) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary principles all the way to the elements.
* **The Coach and the Play Stealer**,  **The Cook and the Chef**.
* It's one of the best mental models you can use to improve your thinking because the essentials allow you to see where reasoning by [[_Analogy]] might lead you astray.

* If we never learn to take something apart, test the assumptions, and reconstruct it, we end up trapped in what other people tell us -- trapped in the way things have always been done.
* Everything that is not a [[Law of Nature]] is just a [[_Shared belief]]. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.

## Techniques for Establishing First Principles
### Socratic Questioning
[[_Socratic]] questioning can be used to establish first principles through [[_Stringent analysis]]. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and normal discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. 
Socratic questioning generally follows this process:
1. Clarify your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this?, What exactly do I think?).
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true?, What if I thought the opposite?).
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up?, What are the sources?).
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think?, How do I know I am correct?).
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong?, What are the consequences if I am?).
6. Questioning the original question (Why did I think that?, Was I correct?, What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?).
* This process stop you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses.
