> **Abstract:** In this note, we learn how to create Anki decks that not only make learning more effective, but also more creativity. Specifically, wer'e going to learn how to create the optimal number of decks to maximize your learning.

## What do you think is the most creative way to learn?
* Is it when you're learning one subject deeply and filtering every idea into the lens of that subject only?
* Or is it when you're learning widely and connecting ideas to form new insights?

The first option is called [[_top-down learning|top-down learning]]. With top-down learning, you start with a predetermined category (determined by the school and its subjects, of course) and then believe that everything in that category should strictly be inside it.

### Why is This Method Sub-optimal?
1. Not every thing you'll learn will be conveniently categorized into topics in the first place -- especially in the real world.
2. Transfer of knowledge from one topic to another becomes essentially difficult.

The reverse approach [[_bottom-up learning|bottom-up learning]] is much better. With this approach, transfer of knowledge from one topic to another is more probable. 

There is no strict hierarchies. The hierarchies that were supposed to be predetermined now **emerges from the cards.**

An analogy:

> If knowledge were a biological system, then each topic is an organ containing a portion of it.
> 
> The organ must have a system to begin with before it can function properly -- otherwise, it's just a useless combination of cells.
> 
> In a similar way, decks are the giant system that has a single function: to make the topics work together, build upon each other, and ultimately create "idea babies" and strong "idea families".

## How Can I Create Decks That Allow Creative Learning?
**Use as few decks as possible**. Ideally, a single deck for continuous learning.

Michael Neilson, one of the pioneers of quantum computing, apparently does the same thing:

> The world isn't divided up into neatly separated components, and I believe it's good to collide very different types of questions. One moment Anki is asking me a question about the temperature chicken should be cooked to. The next: a question about the Javascript API.

---

> ...scores were 25 percent better for problems trained with interleaving; at one month later, the interleaving advantage grew to 76 percent.

Which basically means putting loosely related -- and even unrelated cards into a single deck improves your long-term retention in a snap.

Is deck creation really a big deal?

### If you want to use Anki for learning rather than memorization alone, it becomes a big deal.

Items in your memory should get built upon and associated to by new knowledge, rather than merely get stockpiled and disordered.

### Having too many decks is the antithesis of this concept.

## Next Step: How to Use Anki Efficiently

If you don't really care much about the "inter-topic" or interdisciplinary insights, then i'd say you'd be better off having one deck for each subject.

However, if your goal is to *"build your cognitive infrastructure"*, and not *"save time in the short term"* then **use only a single deck for everything** --  and reap the rewards later on.

Now, creating a single deck might sound like you're going to take even more time doing reviews.

 It doesn't have to be that way.
 
 Thing is , you can reduce your study time --permanently -- while maintaining the quality of your learning.
