# Alcohols - Nomenclature and Classification (Fleeting)
Created: 23-10-2021 18:30

* An alcohol is an organic compound with a [[_hydroxyl|hydroxyl]] ($\ce{OH}$) functional group on an [[_aliphatic|aliphatic]] carbon atom.
* They are represented by the general formula $\ce{ROH}$, where $\ce{R}$ is an [[_alkyl|alkyl group]].
* Alcohols are common in nature.
* ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages.
* According to the [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]], alcohols are named by changing the ending of the [[_Parent Alkane|parent alkane]] name to *-ol*.  
	* In [[Cyclic Alcohols]], the [[Carbon]] atom bearing the $\ce{OH}$ group is designated as the first in counting the [[_LCC|longest carbon chain]], but the 1 is not used in the name.
	* [[Substituents]] are named and numbered as in [[Alkanes]].
	* If more than one $\ce{OH}$  appears in the same molecule ([[_Polyhydroxy alcohols|polyhydroxy alcohols]]), suffixes such as *-diol* and *-triol* are used. 
	* In these cases, the *-e* ending of the [[_Parent Alkane|parent alkane]] is retained.

## Classification of Alcohols
* Some of the properties of alcohols depend on the number of [[Carbon]] atoms attached to the specific carbon atom that is attached to the $\ce{OH}$  group. Alcohols can be grouped into three classes on this basis.
* A **Primary ($1^\circ$)** alcohol is one in which the carbon atom with the $\ce{OH}$ group is attached to one other carbon atom. It's general formula is: $\ce{RCH2OH}$

* A **Secondary ($2^\circ$)** alcohol is one in which the carbon atom with the $\ce{OH}$ group is attached to two other carbon atoms. It's general formula is: $\ce{R2COH}$

* A **Tertiary ($3^\circ$)** alcohol is one in which the carbon atom with the $\ce{OH}$ group is attached to three other carbon atoms. Its general formula is: $\ce{R3COH}$

* Some of the common names reflect a compound's classification as secondary (*sec-*) or tertiary (*tert-*). These designations are not used in the [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]] nomenclature system of alcohols.
