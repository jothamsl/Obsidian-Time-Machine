Created: 26-10-2021 05:28

* [[_alkenes|Alkenes]] are [[_Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] with carbon-to-carbon bonds ($R_2C=CR_2$).
* [[_Alkynes|Alkynes]] are carbon-to-carbon triple bonds ($\ce{R-C#C-R}$).
* They are called [[_unsaturated hydrocarbons|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than an [[_Alkane|alkane]] with the same number of carbon atoms:

* The first two members of the [[_Alkene|alkene]] [[_homologous series|homologous series]] are often called by their common names - ethylene and propylene. 
* Ethylene is a major commercial chemical used to produce [[_polyethylene|polyethylene]], one of the most familiar plastics. 
* Propylene is also an important industrial chemical which is used to produce plastics, isopropyl alcohol, and a variety of other products.

* Although there is only one [[_Alkene|alkene]] with the formula $\ce{C2H4}$(ethene) and only one with the formula $\ce{C3H6}$(propene), there are several alkenes with the formula $\ce{C4H8}$.

## How to Name Alkenes using [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]] Rules
* The [[_LCC|longest chain of carbon atoms]] containing is considered the parent chain. It is named using the same system as [[_Alkane|alkane]] IUPAC system but ends in *-ene* to identify it as an alkene.
