# Alkenes -> Structures & Names (Fleeting)
Created: 26-10-2021 05:28

* [[_alkenes|Alkenes]] are [[_Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] with carbon-to-carbon bonds ($R_2C=CR_2$).
* [[_Alkynes|Alkynes]] are carbon-to-carbon triple bonds ($\ce{R-C#C-R}$).
* They are called [[_unsaturated hydrocarbons|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than an [[_Alkane|alkane]] with the same number of carbon atoms:

* The first two members of the [[_Alkene|alkene]] [[_homologous series|homologous series]] are often called by their common names - ethylene and propylene. 
* Ethylene is a major commercial chemical used to produce [[_polyethylene|polyethylene]], one of the most familiar plastics. 
* Propylene is also an important industrial chemical which is used to produce plastics, isopropyl alcohol, and a variety of other products.

* Although there is only one [[_Alkene|alkene]] with the formula $\ce{C2H4}$(ethene) and only one with the formula $\ce{C3H6}$(propene), there are several alkenes with the formula $\ce{C4H8}$.

## How to Name Alkenes using [[_IUPAC|IUPAC]] Rules
* The [[_LCC|longest chain of carbon atoms]] containing is considered the parent chain. It is named using the same system as [[_Alkane|alkane]] IUPAC system but ends in *-ene* to identify it as an alkene.
* If there are four or more [[Carbon]] atoms in a chain, we must indicate the position of the double bond. The carbon atoms are numbered so that the first of the two that are doubly bonded is given the lower of the two possible numbers. For example, the compound $\ce{CH3CH=CHCH2CH3}$, for example, has the double bond between the second and third carbon atoms. It's name is *2-pentene* (not *3-pentene*).
* [[_substituent|Substituent groups]] are named as with [[_Alkane|alkanes]], and their position is indicated by a number. Thus the structure below is *5-methyl-2-hexene*. Note that the numbering of the parent chain is always done in such a way as to give the [[_double bond (chemistry)|double bond]] the lowest number, even if that causes a substituent to have a higher number. **The double bond has priority in numbering.**

* Just as there are [[Cycloalkanes]], there are [[_cycloalkenes|Cycloalkenes]]. They are names just like alkenes, but with the prefix *cyclo-* attached to the beginning of the parent alkene name.
* Unsaturated hydrocarbons have double or triple bonds are quite reactive; saturated hydrocarbons have only single bonds and are rather nonreactive.
