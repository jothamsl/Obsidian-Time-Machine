> ### **Abstract:**
>  If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? If sound only exists when someone is around to perceive it, then the falling tree produced no sound. However, in physics, we know that colliding objects can disturb the air, water or other matter surrounding them. As a result, the surrounding particles of matter began vibrating a wave-like fashion. This is a sound wave. In this section, we'll learn more about the wave properties of sound, and explore hearing, as well as some special uses for sound.
