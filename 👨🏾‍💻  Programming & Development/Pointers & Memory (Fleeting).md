## Pointers and Memory 
When a C program is compiled it works with three types of memory:
* *Static/Global*
* *Automatic*
* *Dynamic*

### Static/Global Memory
* [[_static variables|Statically declared variables]] are allocated to this type of [[_Memory|memory]].
* [[_global variable|Global variables]] also use this region of memory.
* They are allocated and exist all through the life cycle of the program.
* The [[_scope (programming)|scope]] of static variables is restricted to their defining function.

### Automatic Memory
* These variables are declared within a function and are created when a function is called.
* Their scope is restricted to the function.
* Their lifetime is limited to the time the function is executing.

### Dynamic Memory
*
