## The Bigger Picture

C-code can't actually do anything until it is compiled into an executable binary file. Thinking of C-source as a program is a common misconception that is exploited by hackers every day. Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into machine language for a variety of processor architectures. Each architecture has a different machine language, so the compiler acts as a middle ground - translating C code into machine language for the target architecture. 

The [[_GNU]] development tools include a program called *objdump*, which can be used to examine compiled binaries. 

##### firstprog.c
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int i;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) // Loop 10 times
		puts("Hello world!\n");  // Put the string to the output
	return 0;                    // Tell OS the program exited without errors
}
``` 

if you run `make firstprog && objdum -D firstprog | grep -A20 main.`. you should get an output similar to:

Each byte is represented in *hexadecimal notation*, which is a base-16 numbering system. This is a convenient notation since a byte contains 8 bits, each of which can be either true of false. This means a byte has 256 ($2^8$) possible values, so each byte can be described with 2 hexadecimal digits.

In the image above, the hexadecimal numbers- starting with 0x8048374 on the far left -- are memory addresses. The bits of the machine language instructions must be put somewhere, and this somewhere is called *memory*. [[_Memory]] is just a collection of bytes of temporary storage space that are numbered with addresses.

Older Intel x86 processors use a [[_32-bit]] addressing scheme, while newer ones use a [[_64-bit]] one. The 32-bit processors have $2^{32}$ (or $4,294,967,296$) possible addresses, while the 64-bit ones have $2^{64}$ ($1.84467441\times10^{19}$) possible addresses. The 64-bit processors can run in 32-bit compatibility mode, which allows them to run 32-bit code quickly.
