# Kirchhoff's loop rule

Kirchhoff's loop rule states that the algebraic sum of the [[_potential difference|potential differences]], including voltage supplied by the voltage sources and resistive elements, in any loop must be equal to zero.

Kirchhoff's loop rule states:

$$
V-IR_1-IR_2-IR_3=0
$$

As the voltage travels from the points $abcda$, the voltage decrements as it passes through the resistors.
