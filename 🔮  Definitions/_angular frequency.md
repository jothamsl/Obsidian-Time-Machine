# Angular Frequency

In physics, angular frequency $\omega$ (also referred to by the terms [[_angular speed|angular speed]], [[_radial frequency|radial frequency]], [[_circular frequency|circular frequency]], [[_orbital frequency|orbital frequency]], [[_radian frequency|radian frequency]] and [[_pulsatance|pulsatance]]) is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the angular displacement per unit time (for example, in rotation) or the rate of change in the [[_phase constant|phase]] of a sinusoidal waveform (for example, in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function. 

$$
\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f
$$

Where:
* $\omega$ is the angular frequency (measured in radians per second)
* $T$ is the period (measured in seconds)
* $f$ is the ordinary frequency (measured in hertz)
