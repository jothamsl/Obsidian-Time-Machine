# Coulomb's Law

**Coulob's law**, or **Coulomb's inverse-square law**, is an experimental law of physics that quantified the amount of force between two stationary, electrically charged particles.

The law states that the magnitude of the [[_electrostatic force|electrostatic force]] of attraction or repulsion between two [[_point charge|point charges]] is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
