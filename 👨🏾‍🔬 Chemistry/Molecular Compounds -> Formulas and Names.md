## Compounds Composed of Two Elements
When naming covalent molecules, we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix -ide. The numbers of atoms of each element are designated by the Greek prefixes: 

| Prefix   | Number |
|:-------- |:------:|
| $mono-$  |   1    |
| $di-$    |   2    |
| $tri-$   |   3    |
| $tetra-$ |   4    |
| $penta-$ |   5    |
|          |        |
