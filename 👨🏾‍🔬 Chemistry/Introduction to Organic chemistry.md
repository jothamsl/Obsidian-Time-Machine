> Here, we introduce [[_Organic chemistry]], it's origin and it's concepts and ideas.

## Definition
Organic chemistry is the study of the chemistry involving [[Carbon]] based compounds. It was initially the study of the compounds obtained from living organisms which were deemed organic, until 1828, when [[_Friedrich Wohler]], a German chemist synthesized [[_Urea]] (an organic compound), from inorganic starting materials.

## Origin 
Before the 18th century, chemists generally believed that organic compounds obtained form living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from [[_inorganic compounds]]. At this time it was believed that organic compounds came from only living things. 

## Discovery
In 1828, German chemist [[_Friedrich Wohler]], synthesized [[_Urea]] (carbamide), a constituent of urine, from inorganic starting materials. In 1856, [[_William Henry Perkin]], while trying to manufacture [[_quinine]] accidenta
