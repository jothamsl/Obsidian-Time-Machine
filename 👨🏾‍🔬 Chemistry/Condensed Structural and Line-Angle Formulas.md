## Prerequisites
* Make sure you understand what a [[_Molecular Formula|molecular formula]] is and what it represents.
* Understand the fundamentals of [[_Organic chemistry|organic chemistry]], [[_Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]], [[_Alkane|alkanes]]



## Types of Chemical Formulas
There are several methods or types of chemical formulas which are used in certain scenarios. These methods include:
* [[_Molecular Formula|Molecular formula]]
* [[_Structural Formula|Structural formula]]
* [[_Condensed Structural Formula|Condensed structural formula]]
* [[_Line-Angle Formula|Line-angle Formula]]


But in this note, we will only highlight the ideas and representations behind the [[_Structural Formula|structural formula]], [[_Condensed Structural Formula|condensed structural formula]] and the [[_Line-Angle Formula|line-angle formula]].

## Structural  Formula & Condensed Structural Formula
Molecular formulas show only the elements and numbers of atoms in a [[_Molecule]]. In most cases this is a very useful and neat representation of a [[_Compound]] but, has it's limits as the complexity of compounds slowly increase. e.g: In [[_Organic chemistry]], molecular formulas aren't used often because when given an [[_Alkane]] like *hexane* ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3}$) for example, molecular formulas can't represent an [[_Isomer]] of the organic compound (like *isohexane*, [$\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2}$]). 

A [[_Structural Formula]] shows all the [[Carbon]] and [[Hydrogen]] atoms and the bonds attaching them. A [[_Condensed Structural Formula]] also does this but doesn't show the bonds attaching each carbon and hydrogen atom. Thus structural formulas (and too some degree condensed structural formulas) solve the isomer problem.

## Line-Angle Formula
Line-angle formulas are the ultimate condensed chemical formula in which each [[Carbon]] atom of an organic compound is implied at the corners and ends of a zig-zig like line. Each carbon atom is understood to be attached to enough [[Hydrogen]] atoms to give a fully [[_saturated]] carbon atom.
e.g: we can represent *pentane* ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3}$) and *isopentane* [$\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2CH3}$] as:

Each corner is a [[Carbon]] atom and is attached to another corner (carbon atom). For isomers, a corner is connected to another line which leads to a [[_substituent]].
