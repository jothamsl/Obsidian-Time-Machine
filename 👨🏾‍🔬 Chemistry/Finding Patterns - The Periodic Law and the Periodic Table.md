[[_Rutherford model|Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom]] helped explain why atoms of different elements exhibit different chemical behavior.

In the [[_periodic table|periodic table]], elements are arranged in order of increasing [[_atomic number|atomic number]] ($Z$). 

The chemistry of each element is determined by its number of protons and electrons.

The periodic table summarizes huge amounts of information about the elements in a way that facilitates the prediction of many of their properties and chemical reactions. The elements are arranged in 7 rows, in order of increasing atomic number from left to right and top to bottom.

The rows are called *periods* and they are numbered 1 through 7. The elements are stacked in such a way that elements with similar chemical properties form vertical columns, called *groups*, numbered from 1 through 18.

Groups **1, 2 and 13-18** are the main group elements. Groups **3-12** are the [[_transition elements|transition elements]]. The two rows of 14 elements at the bottom of the periodic table are the [[_lanthanides|lanthanides]] and the [[_actinides|actinides]], whose position in the periodic table are in group 3.

## Metals, Nonmetals and Semimetals

The orange zig-zag line above which runs diagonally from the upper left to the lower right through groups **13-16**, divides the elements into metals and nonmetals.

The vast majority of the known elements are metals. Of the metals, only mercury is liquid at room temperature and pressure; all the rest are solids.
