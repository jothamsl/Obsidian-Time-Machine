A chemical formula is a format used to express the structure of atoms.

## Molecular Geometry and Structural Formula
[[_Isomer|Isomers]] are compounds in which two molecules can have the same number of atoms, and thus the same molecular formula, but can have completely different physical and chemical properties because of their differences in structural formula.

### Polymers
A [[_polymer|Polymer]] is formed when small molecules of identical structure, [[_monomer|monomers]], combine into a large cluster. The monomers are joined together by [[_covalent bonds|covalent bonds]]. When monomers repeat and bind, they form a polymer. When a molecule has more than one of these polymers, square parenthesis are used to show that all the elements within the polymer are multiplied by the subscript outside the parenthesis.

### Empirical Formula
An empirical formula show the most basic form of a compound. Empirical formulas show the number of atoms of each element in a compound in the most simplified state using whole numbers. 
E.g Find the empirical formula for $\ce{C8H16O2}$ 
Answer: $\ce{C4H8O}$ (divide all subscripts by 2 to get the smallest, whole number ratio)

### Molecular Formula
The molecular formula is based on the actual makeup of the compound. Although the molecular formula can sometimes be the same as the empirical formula, molecular compounds tend to be more helpful. However, they do nto describe how the atoms are put together.

### Structural Formula
A structural Formula displays the atoms of the molecule in the order they are bonded. [[_covalent bonds|Covalent bonds]] are shown using lines. Structural formulas are helpful because they explain the properties and structure of the compound which empirical and molecular formulas cannot always represent.
