# Identifying Good Problems for ML
created: 2021-08-21 16:56

## Clear Use Case
Focus on problems that would be difficult to solve with traditional programming. Start with the problem, not the solution. Make sure that you aren't treating ML as a hammer for all your problems. Ask you self the following:
* What problem is my product facing?
* Would it be a good problem for ML?

**Don't ask the questions the other way round!**

## Know the Problem Before Focusing on the Data
If you understand the problem clearly, you should be able to list some potential solutions to test in order to generate the best model. Exploratory data analysis can help you understand your data, but you can't yet claim that patterns you find generalize until you check those patterns against previously unseen data. This could reinforce stereotypes or bias.

**Be prepared to have your assumptions challenged!**
