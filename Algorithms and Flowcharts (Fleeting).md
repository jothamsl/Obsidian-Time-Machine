* An [[_algorithm|algorithm]] is a set of precisely defined steps which are used to arrive at a predictable output with the aim of solving a problem.
* A typical programming task can be divided into two phases:
	* **Problem solving phase**: Producing an algorithm that describes the solution to a problem.
	* **Implementation phase**: Implementing the algorithm in a programming language.

## Functions of an Algorithm
* An algorithm performs a specific task (Solving the current problem) in the program flow.
* It optimizes the process of code implementation.
* It creates flow and direction in the program
* It forms the foundation of computer programming.
* An algorithm produces an efficient program.

## Characteristics of a Good algorithm
* A good algorithm is capable of taking in input
* A good algorithm produces output
* *Generality*: It applies to a specified set of inputs
* *Precision*: The steps are precisely stated.
* *Finite*: A good algorithm
