If you find the derivative of a function $f$, you get $f^{'}$. You can actually take this new function and differentiate it again. You end up with the derivative of the derivative; this is called the *second derivative*, and it's written as $f^{''}$. 

If $y=f(x)=x^2$, then we've seen that:

But why stop at taking two derivatives? The third derivative of a function $f$ is the [[Derivative]] of the derivative of the derivative of $f$. It can be thought of as the derivative of the second derivative of $f$, and it can be written as:

The notation $f^{(3)}(x)$ is particularly convenient for higher derivatives.

It is even possible to write $f^{1}(x)$ instead of $f^{'}(x)$, it's also valid to write $f^{0}(x)$ instead of $f(x)$
