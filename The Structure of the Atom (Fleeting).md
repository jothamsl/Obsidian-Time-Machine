## The Atom
The [[_nucleus|nucleus]] contains the majority of an atom's mass because **protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons**.

Electrons occupy almost all of an atom's volume.

One [[_amu|amu]] (atomic mass unit) is exactly $1/12$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1\ amu=1.6605\cdot 10^{-24}$. The [[_elementary charge|fundamental unit of charge]] (also called [[_elementary charge|elementary charge]]) equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron (*e*) with $e=1.602\cdot 10^{-19}$

A proton has a mass of $1.0073\ amu$ and a charge of $1+$. 

A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass of $1.0087\ amu$

An electron has a charge of $1-$ and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about $0.00055\ amu$

The sum of an atom's subatomic particles does not equal the atom's actual mass.

The number of protons in the [[_nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom is it's [[_atomic number|atomic number]] ($Z$). This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom.

A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. The atomic number therefore indicates the number of electrons in an atom.

The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its [[_mass number|mass number]] ($A$). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number:  $A-Z=number\ of\ electrons$
$$
atomic\ number\ (Z)=number\ of\ protons $$
$$
mass\ number\ (A)=number\ of\ protons+number\ of\ neutrons
$$
$$number\ of\ neutrons=A-Z$$

When the values of the [[_subatomic particles|subatomic particles]] are not equal, the atom is electrically charged and is called an [[_ion|ion]]. The charge of an atom is defined as:
$$Atomic\ charge=number\ of\ protons-number\ of\ electrons$$

An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an [[_anion|anion]]. Positively charged atoms called [[_cations|cations]] are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons.

## Chemical Symbols
A chemical symbols is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an [[_element|element]] or an atom of an element.

## Isotopes
The symbols for a specific [[_isotope|isotope]] of any element is written by placing the [[_mass number|mass number]] as a superscript to the left of the element symbol. The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol.

Isotopy is caused by the difference in neutron number in an element. This changes the mass number but not the atomic number of an element.

## Atomic Mass
Because each proton and each neutron contribute approximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less, the atomic mass of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a whole number). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers because most elements exist naturally as mixture of two or more isotopes.

The mass of an element shown in a period table or listed in a table of atomic masses is a [[_weighted sum|weighted, average mass]] of all the isotopes present in a naturally occurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individual isotope's mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.

$$
average\ mass=\sum_{i}(fractional\ abundance\cdot isotopic\ mass)
$$

**NOTE:** Remember the difference between: *atomic mass*, *Mass number*, *Average atomic mass*.

**Atomic mass**: Mass of a single atom of an element
**Mass number**: Mass number of a single element
**Average atomic mass**: Weighted sum of atomic masses of isotopes of element.
