# Unsaturated & Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Created: 25-10-2021 15:45

> ### **Abstract:**
> Aromatic hydrocarbons have formulas that can be drawn as [[_cyclic alkenes]], making them appear unsaturated, but their structure and properties are generally quite different, so they are not considered to be [[_alkenes]]. Aromatic compounds serve as the basis for many drugs, antiseptics, explosives, solvents and plastics (e.g polyesters and polystyrene).
