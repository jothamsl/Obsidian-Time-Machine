ADH also known as **arginine vasopressin** or **argipressin**, is a hormone which is produced by the hypothalamus in the pituitary gland. It's job is to manage the water level in the blood by making the kidney tubules more water permeable. A high water concentration increases the volume and pressure of your blood. [[Osmoreceptors]] and [[Baroreceptors]] work with ADH to maintain water metabolism.
