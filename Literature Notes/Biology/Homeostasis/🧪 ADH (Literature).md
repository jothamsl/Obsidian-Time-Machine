ADH (Anti-diuretic hormone) also known as **arginine vasopressin** or **argipressin**, is a hormone which is produced by the [[Hypothalamus]] in the [[Pituitary gland]]. It's job is to manage the water level in the blood by making the kidney tubules more water permeable. A high water concentration increases the volume and pressure of your blood. [[Osmoreceptors]] and [[Baroreceptors]] work with ADH to maintain water metabolism.

Osmotic sensors in the [[Hypothalamus]] react to the concentration of particles in the blood. These particles include molecules of *Sodium*, *potassium*, *chloride* and *carbon dioxide*. When particle concentration isn't balanced, or [[Blood pressure]] is too low, these sensors and [[Baroreceptors]] tell your kidneys to store or release water to maintain a healthy range of these substances. They also regulate your body's sense of thirst.

[[Blood osmotic pressure]] rises due to the following:
* Sweating Profusely
* Drinking very little water 
* Eating too much salt

When blood osmotic pressure rises:
* [[Osmoreceptors]] in the [[Hypothalamus]] detect the change in osmotic pressure.
* The [[Pituitary gland]] secretes ADH which is transferred to the kidney.
* It makes the kidney tubules more water permeable which leads to an increases the rate of water reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate into the blood.
* The urine passed out is more concentrated and smaller in quantity. On a hot day the urine may be dark colored.
* This  continues until the osmotic pressure falls.
