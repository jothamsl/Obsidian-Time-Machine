At fertilization, the male parent contributes one member of each homologous pair to the offpsring, and the female parent contributes the other. With the exception of the sex chromosomes, homologous chromosomes contain the same genes which may vary, they are called **Alleles**. 

In **Meiosis I** & **Meiosis II**, usually four daughter cells are formed, with each having half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell (*1n*). 

**REMEBER:** During **Meiosis**, DNA replicates ONCE but divides TWICE, whereas in **Mitosis**, DNA replicates ONCE and divides only ONCE.

Genetic variation occurs during **Meiosis I**, in which homologous chromomsomes pair and exchange non-sister chromatid segments (crossover). Here the homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei, causing a reduction in "Ploidy". During **Meiosis II** (which is more similar to mitotic division), the chromatids separate and segregate into four haploid sex cells. However, because of the crossover, the resultant daugher cells do not contain identical genomes.

## Meiosis
Meiosis is a special type of cell division of germ cells in sexually-reproducing organisms used to produce the gametes, such as sperm or egg cells.

Meiosis is precedded by an **interphase** consisting of the
