# How To Remember What You Read
created: 2021-10-20 08:42

In order to remember what you read, you need to be more focused and involved with the article or book. Comparing the differences between people that skim through the text and those that actually absorb the content at a deeper level, an observation is made. Engaged readers are always making associations with between what they are reading and what they already know.

**1st Practical Takeaway:** If you want to remember more of what read, do your best to eliminate distractions before turning to your reading material.

**2nd Practical Takeaway:** *Active Reading*-- taking notes, sketching and talking with a friend about the text -- can also help forge mental connections between the information you're taking in and what you already know, increasing your retention.

> "The good reader, goes beyond knowledge, goes beyond emotions and perspective-taking, into a realm where the furthest reaches of our thoughts can be generated"
\- Maryanne Wolf

The ultimate goal of reading shouldn't just be memorization, but reflection and insight.
