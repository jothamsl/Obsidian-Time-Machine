# ðŸ§¨ Newton's Third Law of Motion
created: 2021-09-11 12:59

**Newton's Third law** states the following:
> * When a body exerts a force on an object or another body, the body experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.

Newtonâ€™s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.
