**Prev** -> [[ðŸ›©  Newton's Second Law of Motion]]

**Newton's Third law** states the following:
> * When a body exerts a force on an object or another body, the body experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.

Newtonâ€™s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.

Examples of Newtonâ€™s third law are easy to find. As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.

Another example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.

## Applying Newton's Third Law
The normal force is the force that a surface applies to an object to support the weight of that object; it acts perpendicular to the surface upon which the object rests. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external force ([[ðŸ’¨ Force#^573912]])is zero, and the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In equation form, we write that:

$$N=mg$$
Note that this equation is only true for a horizontal surface.

	<summary><b>What is Tension?</b></summary>
	The word tension comes from the Latin word meaning <i>to stretch</i>. Tension is the force which acts along the length of a flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain or cable.

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass. If the $5.00\ kg$ mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, so $F_{net}=0$. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight $W$ and the tension $T$ supplied by the rope. Summing the external forces to find the net force, we obtain

$$F_{net}=T-W=0$$

Where $T$ and $W$ are the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive. By substituting $mg$ for $F_{net}$ and rearranging the equation, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass, just as you would expect.
$$T=W=mg$$
For a $5.00\ kg$ mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that
$$T=mg=(5.00\ kg)(9.80\ m/s^2)=49.0N$$
