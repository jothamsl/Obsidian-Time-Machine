created: 2021-09-08 18:19

**Newton's first law of motion** states the following:
* A body at rest tends to remain at rest
* A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a [[ðŸ’¨ Force^net external force]]. *(recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed)*
