# ðŸ¥¼ Newton's First Law & Friction
created: 2021-09-08 18:19

**Newton's first law of motion** states the following:
> * A body at rest tends to remain at rest
> * A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force ([[ðŸ’¨ Force#^573912]]). *(recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed)*

	<summary><b>What is Friction?</b></summary>
		Friction is an external force that acts in the opposite direction of motion.
