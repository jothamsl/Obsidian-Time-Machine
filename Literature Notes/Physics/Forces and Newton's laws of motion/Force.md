Force is the cause of motion. The study of motion is called **[[kinematics]]**. Kinematics only describes the way objects move (velocity, Acceleration). **[[Dynamics]]** considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems.

Newton's laws of motion describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion and interact with other objects. They are also universal: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.
