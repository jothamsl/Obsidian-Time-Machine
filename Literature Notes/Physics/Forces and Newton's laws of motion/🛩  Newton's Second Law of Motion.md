**Newton's second law of motion** states the following:

> * The time rate of change of momentum is equal to the force acting on the particle.
> * The rate of a change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.

This law essentially describes how force causes changes in motion and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as
$$
	F_{net}=ma\ \ \ or \ \ \ \sum{F} = ma
$$

Where $F_{net}$ (or $\sum f$) is the net external force, $m$ is the mass of the system, and $a$ is the acceleration.

	<summary><b>What is change in motion?</b></summary>
		A change in motion is simply a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred.
</details>

From the equation $F_{net}=ma$, we see that force is directly proportional to both mass an acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.

Rearranging Newton's second law to solve for acceleration. We get:

$$a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}\ \ \ or \ \ \ a=\frac{\sum F}{m} $$

In this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional force, which we write as:

$$a\propto F_{net}$$

**Note:** When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double. When one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number.

It is also clear from the equation $a=F_{net}/m$ that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as 

$$a\propto \frac{1}{m}$$
