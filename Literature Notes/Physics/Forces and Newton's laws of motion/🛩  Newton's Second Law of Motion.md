**Newton's second law of motion** states the following:

> * The time rate of change of momentum is equal to the force acting on the particle.
> * The rate of a change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.

This law essentially describes how force causes changes in motion and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as
$$
	F_{net}=ma\ \ \ or \ \ \ \sum{F} = ma
$$

Where $F_{net}$ (or $\sum f$) is the net external force, $m$ is the mass of the system, and $a$ is the acceleration.
