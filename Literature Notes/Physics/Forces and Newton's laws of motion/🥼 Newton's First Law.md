**Next** -> [[ðŸ›©  Newton's Second Law of Motion]]

**Newton's first law of motion** states the following:
> * A body at rest tends to remain at rest
> * A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force ([[ðŸ’¨ Force#^573912]]). *(recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed)*

	<summary><b>What is Friction?</b></summary>
		Friction is an external force that acts in the opposite direction of motion.

	<summary><b>What is the Normal force?</b></summary>
		This is a force exerted by a surface that pushes against an object in response to gravity pulling the object down.,
</details>

The force of friction depends on two factors:
* The coefficient of friction and 
* The normal force. 

For any two surfaces that are in contact, the **Coefficient of friction** is a constant that depends on the nature of the surfaces. In equation form, the force of friction is 

$$f=\upmu N$$

Where $\upmu$ is the coefficient of friction and $N$ is the normal force.

		A system is one or more objects that you choose to study.

## Mass and Inertia
[**Inertia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia) is the tendency for an object at rest to remain at rest,  or for a moving object to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed. Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into his first law, which is often referred to as the **Law of inertia**.

The inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object.

	<summary><b>What is Mass?</b></summary>
		Mass is a measure of the amount of matter (or stuff) in a body. The quantity of amount of matter in an object is determined by the number and types of atoms the object contains. Unlike weight which changes if the gravitational force changes too, mass does not depend on gravity.
