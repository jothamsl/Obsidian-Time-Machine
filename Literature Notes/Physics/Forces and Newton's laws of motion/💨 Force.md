Force is the cause of motion. The study of motion is called **[[kinematics]]**. Kinematics only describes the way objects move (velocity, Acceleration). **[[Dynamics]]** considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems.

Newton's laws of motion describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion and interact with other objects. They are also universal: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.

	<summary><b>What is a Force?</b></summary>
	A force is some external or internal exertion which can act upon a body through contact or no contact.
</details>

The sum of the total amount of forces acting upon a body is called the **Total force** or **Net force**. An **External Force** is a force that acts on an object within a system from outside the system while an **Internal Force** is a force that acts in-between two objects in a system.

	<summary><b>What is a Net External Force?</b></summary>
	This is the total sum of all external forces in a system.

In mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative), with the left or down direction showing a negative sign and the right or up direction showing a positive sign.

**NOTE:** It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system within a problem; for example., if negative values are assigned to the downward direction for velocity, then distance, force and acceleration should also be designated as being negative in the downward direction.

	<summary><b>What is a free-body diagram?</b></summary>
		A free-body diagram is a diagram which represents the object being acted upon. Only the forces acting on the body are shown and are represented by vectors.
