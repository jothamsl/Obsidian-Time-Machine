**Rotational motion** is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. **Circular motion** is when an object moves in a circular path, e.g a race-car speeding around a circular curve. **Spin** is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis.

	<summary><b>What is Angular Velocity?</b></summary>
		This is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.

The **Arc length**, is the distance traveled along a circular path. The **radius of curvature**, $r$, is the radius of the circular path.

The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of rotation $\Delta\theta$ is the arc length divided by the radius of the curvature.

$$\Delta\theta = \frac{\Delta s}{r}$$

	<summary><b>What are Radians?</b></summary>
		These are the ratio of the radius to the arc length of a circle.

**Angular Speed ** ($\omega$) is the angular version of linear velocity $v$.  **Tangential velocity** is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion.
