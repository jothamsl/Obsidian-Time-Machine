**Rotational motion** is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. **Circular motion** is when an object moves in a circular path, e.g a race-car speeding around a circular curve. **Spin** is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis.
