## The Bigger Picture

C-code can't actually do anything until it is compiled into an executable binary file. Thinking of C-source as a program is a common misconception that is exploited by hackers every day. Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into machine language for a variety of processor architectures. Each architecture has a different machine language, so the compiler acts as a middle ground - translating C code into machine language for the target architecture. 

The [[GNU]] development tools include a program called *objdump*, which can be used to examine compiled binaries. 

##### firstprog.c
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int i;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) // Loop 10 times
		puts("Hello world!\n");  // Put the string to the output
	return 0;                    // Tell OS the program exited without errors
}
``` 

if you run `make firstprog && objdum -D firstprog | grep -A20 main.`. you should get an output similar to:
