## The Feynman Technique
There are several methods of studying content, one of the most effective is the **Feynman** technique.

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was a brilliant, eloquent and exquisitly passionate thinker. In the world of science, he stand unequivocally for his ability to synthesize and explain complex scientific knowledge.

The Feynman technique of teaching and communication is a mental model (a breakdown of his personal though process) to convey information using concise thougts and simple language. This model can be used to quickly learn new concepts, shore up knowledge gaps you have (known as targeted learning), recall ideas you don't want to forget or study more efficiently. 

Feynman's technique is also useful for those that find writing a challenge.

<blockquote>
	"In order to talke to each other, we have to have words, and that's all right. It's a good idea to try to see the difference, and it's a good idea to know when we are teaching the tools of science, such as words, and when we are teaching science itself" <i>Richard Feynman</i>
</blockquote>

Essentially, the Feynman Technique works like this:
1. **Identify the subject:** Write down every thing you know about the topic. Each time you run into new sources of information, add them to the note.
2. **Teach it to a child:** If you can teach a concept to a child, you're way ahead of the game. 
	Start with a blank note and write the topic or subject you want to teach. Then, below that topic, write everything you know about it. But, the trick is to write it plainly and simply ‚Äî so that a child can understand what you‚Äôre talking about.
	The notes/knowledge should be:
	**Spoken in plain terms** 
	**Breif**
3. **Identify your knowledge gaps:** This is the point where your learning happens. What are you missing?, what don't you know?
	If you don't know something, hit the books. Go back to the source material and compile information that will help you fill in the cracks.
4. **Organize + simplify + tell a story:** Start to tell your story. Piece together your notes and begin to spin a tale using concise explanations. Bring the most vital pieces of your knowledge about the topic together. 
	practice reading your story out loud. Pretend to tell the story to a classroom of students. That way, you'll hear where language stops being simple.
	Use analogies and simple sentences to strengthen your understanding of the story.
