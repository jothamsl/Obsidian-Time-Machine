* Successful people have several common traits, one of those traits being their ablility to **prioritize**. They work on better things, things that actually matter at the current moment or later at some point.
* If you want to prioritize, you need to get a view of how your goals and ambitions work first or learn something about them that you don't have enough information on. This way, you can accurately pick what will yield a higher impact.
* You need to ask yourself "what steps will actually make me more likely to achieve my goals?". Asking yourself this lays the foundation of what you need to achieve them, it could possibly even identify what your doing wrong. ðŸŒ¿
