These lines have different slopes. That is, the slope of the tangent line depends on which value of $x$ you start with. Another way of saying this is that the slope of the tangent line through $(x,f(x))$ is itself a function of $x$. This function is called the [[Derivative]] of $f$ and is written as $f^{'}$. We say that we have differentiated the function f with respect to its variable $x$ to get the function $f^{'}$. By the [[Difference quotient]] formula we say the $f$ is differentiable at $x$
