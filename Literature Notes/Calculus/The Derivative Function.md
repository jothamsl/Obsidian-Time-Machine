These lines have different slopes. That is, the slope of the tangent line depends on which value of $x$ you start with. Another way of saying this is that the slope of the tangent line through $(x,f(x))$ is itself a function of $x$. This function is called the [[Derivative]] of $f$ and is written as $f^{'}$. We say that we have *differentiated* the function f with respect to its variable $x$ to get the function $f^{'}$. By the [[Difference quotient]] formula we say the $f$ is *differentiable* at $x$. 

If the limit doesn't exist for some particular $x$, then that value of $x$ is not in the domain of the derivative function $f^{'}$. So we say that $x$ is *not differentiable* at $x$. 

#### Cases where the limit could fail to exist
* The limit of a function could fail to exist where there is a sharp corner.
* If $x$ isn't in the domain of $f$, then you can't even plot the point $(x,f(x))$, let alone draw a tangent line there!
