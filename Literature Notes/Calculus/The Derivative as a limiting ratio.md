# The Derivative as a limiting ratio

In the [[Difference quotient]] formula, we have to evaluate the quantity $f(x+h)$. What is this quantity? Well, if $y=f(x)$, and you change $x$ into $f(x+h)$, then $f(x+h)$ is simply the new value of $y$. The amount $h$ represents how much you change $x$, so let's replace it by the quantity $\Delta x$. So, rewriting the $f^{'}(x)$ formula (or difference quotient ), with $h$ replaced with $\Delta x$:

$$
f^{'}(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x +\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
