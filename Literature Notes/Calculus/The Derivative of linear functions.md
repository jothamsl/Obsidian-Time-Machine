# The Derivative of linear functions
created: 2021-10-21 19:26

For a linear function defined as $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the [[Slope]] and $b$ is the [[Y-intercept]], the [[Tangent]] to the [[Function]] $f(x)$ at any point $(x,f(x))$ is equal to the line of the [[Function]] itself! This means that the value of $f^{'}(x)$ should be $m$ no matter what $x$ is: the curve $y=mx+b$ has a constant slope $m$. Let's check out the formula:

**REM:** The derivative of a linear function is constant & the derivative of a constant function is 0.

Only linear functions have a constant slope.
