## Cations and Anions

When a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, the total number of electrons decreases while the total number of protons in the nucleus remains the same. This results in a [[Cation]].

When a neutral atom gains one or more electrons, the total number of electrons increases while the total number of protons in the nucleus remains the same. The result is that the atom becomes an [[Anion]]. This can be illustrated by examining the cations and anions formed when a single hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron.
