> ### **Abstract:**
> More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, Charles Augusting de Coulomb mathematically described the force between charged objects.

The French scientist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]] mathematically described the force between charged objects. In order to measure this, he built a device called a [[_torsion balanc|torsion balance]].

From measurements obtained by the torsion balance, he deduced that the electrical force between the two spheres in the balance, was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres:

$$F\ \alpha\ \frac{1}{r^2}$$

Where $r$ is the distance between the spheres.

He also deduced that the force is proportional to the charge on each sphere:

$$F\ \alpha\ q_Aq_B$$

Combining these two proportions, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged spheres:

$$F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$

This equation is known as [[_coulomb's law|Coulomb's law]], and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant $K$ is called *coulomb's constant*. In SI units, the constant $K$ has the value $K=8.99\cdot 10^9Nm^2/C^2$

The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb's law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb's law give a positive result which means that the force between them is repulsive.
