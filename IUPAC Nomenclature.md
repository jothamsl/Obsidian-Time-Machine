> ### **Abstract:** In this note, we explore how to name organic compounds.

The numbers of [[_Isomer|isomers]] increases rapidly as the number of carbon atoms increases.

An [[_alkyl|alkyl group]] is a group of atoms that result when one hydrogen atom is removed from an [[_Alkane|alkane]]. The group is named by replacing the *-ane* suffix of the parent hydrocarbon with *-yl*.

## IUPAC rules for naming Alkanes
1. Name alkanes according to the [[_LCC|LCC]] (longest continuous chain) of carbon atoms in the molecule (rather than the total number of carbon atoms)
2. If the hydrocarbon is branched, number the carbon atoms of the LCC.
3. Place the names of the substituent groups in alphabetical order before the name of the parent compound.
