> ## Abstract:


## Definition
* **Manufacturing**: This is the process of converting raw materials into new products through mechanical or chemical processes in a factory or industrial workspace.

## Classification of Manufacturing Industries
### Priamary Industries
* These are also known as [[_extractive industries|extractive industries]]
* They are involved in the extraction of raw materials provided by nature. 
* Examples are: mining, fishing, lumbering, farming, livestock production etc.

### Secondary Industries
* These industries convert raw materials into finished products or consumable goods.
* Examples are: Textile, ship building, construction, iron, steel and chemical industries.

### Tertiary Industries
* Tertiary industries are concerned with provision of services.
* It could be direct services like trading, banking, teaching, insurance and transportation or it could be indirect services like the police, customs, army etc.

Manufacturing can also be classified based on a different paradigm of categorization:
### Light Industries:
* [[_light industries|light industries]] are industries that produce relatively light weight goods such as matches, televisions, sets, fans, books e.t.c.
* They employ the services of mainly women.
* They usually make use of partially processed materials in production.
* They produce consumable goods.
* They are [[#Secondary Industries|secondary industries]].
* They are found mainly in the Tropical regions of Africa.

### Heavy Industries:
* [[_heavy industries|Heavy industries]] produce heavy or bulky goods.
* The employ the services of mainly males.
* They are also secondary industries.
* Examples are: ship construction, motor assembly, petroleum industries e.t.c.
* They are found in *Europe*, *USA*, *Germany* and *Japan*.

### Consumer Good Industries:
* These industries produce consumable goods from raw materials.
* They employ both males and females
* They produce goods like meat, dairy products, beer, coffee, spirits etc.

## Differences between Heavy and Light Industries
1. Heavy industries produce large-scale products while light industries produce small-scale products.
2. Heavy industries are mostly owned my international corporations while the  majority of light industries are owned by local corporations.
3. Usually the turn over of heavy industries are more than that of light industries. **TODO**: What is turnover?
4. Heavy industries are operate at a larger scale than light industries.
5. Heavy industries employ the services of more males while light industries employ the services of more females.

## Characteristics of Manufacturing Industries in Tropical Africa
1. They are dominated by foreign multinational corporations.
2. They are dependent on foreign countries for raw materials.
3. They are depend on imported machinery.
4. They are mainly [[#Light Industries|light industries]].
5. They are based in towns and cities.
6. They are labor intensive.
7. Their products are mostly consumed internally in local markets.

## Reasons for Concentration of Manufacturing Industries in Urban Centers
* The **availability of raw materials ** enables corporations to invest in the production of consumable goods.
* **Large markets** provide an environment for trade, especially in urban areas which are densely populated.
* **Availability of labor** (both skilled and unskilled) provides the necessary means for production. 
* An **efficient transport system** is the bridge between production and sales. Having one, allows a corporation to meet up with supply and demand.
* **Nearness to seaports and airports** is a characteristic of having an efficient transport system. The distance between the point of production and the seaport can affect the chain of supply and demand.
* **Availability of finance** promotes a more dynamic approach towards manufacturing by providing corporations the necessary means for efficient transportation, prioritized marketing e.t.c.
* **Good Government policies** makes it easier to manufacture and transport goods to different places.

## Factors Affecting the Location of Industries in Tropical Africa.
* Proximity to the source of raw materials.
* Distance to market.
* Nearness to source of power
* Availability of labor
* Political stability
* Adequate and functional transport network 
* Availability of capital/finance.
