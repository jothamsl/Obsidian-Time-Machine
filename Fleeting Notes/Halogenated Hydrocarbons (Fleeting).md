# Halogenated Hydrocarbons
Created: 2021-10-23 11:24

* [[Alkanes]] react with [[Halogens]] to produce [[Halogenated Hydrocarbons]].
* Compounds which the [[Carbon]] atoms are joined in a ring or cyclic fashion are called [[Cycloalkanes]].
* The replacement of only one hydrogen atom, gives an [[Alkyl halide]](or [[Halo-alkane]]).
* The common names of alkyl halides consist of two parts:
	1. The name of the [[Alkyl]] group +
	2. The stem of the name of the halogen with the suffix '-ide'. 
* The [[IUPAC]] system uses the name of the [[Parent Alkane]] with a prefix indicating the halogen [[Substituents]], preceded by the number indicating the substituent's location. (The prefix are of the form: *fluoro-*, *chloro-*, *bromo*). e.g $CH_3CH_2Cl$ has the common name $ethyl\ chloride$ and the IUPAC name $chloroethane$.
* Alkyl halides e
