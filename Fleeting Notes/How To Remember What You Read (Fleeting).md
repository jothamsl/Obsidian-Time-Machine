**1st Practical Takeaway:** If you want to remember more of what read, do your best to eliminate distractions before turning to your reading material.

**2nd Practical Takeaway:** *Active Reading*-- taking notes, sketching and talking with a friend about the text -- can also help forge mental connections between the information you're taking in and what you already know, increasing your retention.

It's okay to take notes of important ideas or chapters behind the book. Take down ideas, story parts, quotes and facts, along with their corresponding chapters and lines.

Use the bottom left corner of the page for that date when you finished reading the book. If you finished reading the book more than once, write the multiple dates.
