# How To Remember What You Read
created: 2021-10-20 08:42

In order to remember what you read, you need to be more focused and involved with the article or book. Comparing the differences between people that skim through the text and those that actually absorb the content at a deeper level, an observation is made. Engaged readers are always making associations with between what they are reading and what they already know.
