## The Feynman Technique
* The first step to understanding anything is by using the **Feynman technique**.
* It is essentially asking yourself if you understand what your are reading/studying.
* After reading through a subject or topic, ask yourself:
	1. Does this make sense?
	2. Could I explain it to a 5-year old?
* Some guidelines for this technique:
	1. Keep the language simple.
	2. Drill down to the essence

## Active Recall
* This is the process of testing yourself, in order to check how much you can recall on a certain topic.
* Active recall can be considered as more than just a judgment exercise on how well we understand the content after learning about it. It can and possibly should be considered as part of the learning process.
* The more the brain has to work to do something, the more the effortful the learning is, the more connections are made and strengthened. 

## Taking Notes During Class
* Taking notes by hand is much more effective than typing notes.
* Use the **Cornell note taking**  method.

## Taking Notes After Class
* Take notes after class to:
 	* **Build active recall questions**
 	* **Consolidate understanding**
* Expand using multiple sources to help understand concepts.
* Using the Cornell note method, create questions from your notes.

## Scoping The Subject
* When studying, figure out where the subject or topic fits in the full picture.
* Have a bird's eye view rather than a frog's eye view.
