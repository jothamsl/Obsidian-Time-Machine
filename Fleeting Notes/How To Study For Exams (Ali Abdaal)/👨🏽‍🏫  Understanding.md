* The first step to understanding anything is by using the **Feynman technique**.
* It is essentially asking yourself if you understand what your are reading/studying.
* After reading through a subject or topic, ask yourself:

	2. Could I explain it to a 5-year old?
* Some guidelines for this technique:
	1. Keep the language simple.
	2. Drill down to the essence
