## The Feynman Technique
* The first step to understanding anything is by using the **Feynman technique**.
* It is essentially asking yourself if you understand what your are reading/studying.
* After reading through a subject or topic, ask yourself:
	1. Does this make sense?
	2. Could I explain it to a 5-year old?
* Some guidelines for this technique:
	1. Keep the language simple.
	2. Drill down to the essence

## Active Recall
* This is the process of testing yourself, inorder to check how much you can recall on a certain topic.
* Active recall can be considered as more than just a judgement exercise on how well we understand the content after learning about it. It can and possibly should be considered as part of the learning process.
* The more the brain has to work to do something, the more the effortfull the learning is, the more connctions are made and strengthened.
