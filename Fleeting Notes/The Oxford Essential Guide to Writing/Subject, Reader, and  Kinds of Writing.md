## Choosing a Subject
When selecting a subject, it should be something that interests you and your readers, at least potentially. It should be within the range of your experience and skill

## About Readers
You don't want to repel readers. Don't suppose that it's the readers' job to follow you. It's your job to guide them, to make their task as easy as the subject allows.

## How?
Ask yourself questions about your readers: 
* What can I expect them to know and not know?
* What do they believe and value?
* How do I want to affect them by what I say?
* What attitudes and claims will meet with their approval?
* What will offend them?
* What objections may they have to my ideas, and
* How can I anticipate and counter those objections?

Readers my be annoyed if you overestimate their knowledge.

## Kinds of Writing
A writer may wish to:
* Inform
* Persuade
* Entertain

The most common prose, depending on what it's about is called **exposition**, **description** or **narration**.

**Exposition** explains. How things work. Ideas. History. What ever the subject, exposition reveals what a particular mind thinks or knows or believes. It is constructed logically. It is organized around cause/effect, true/false, less/more. Its movement is signaled by connectives like: *therefore*, *however*, *and so*, *besides*, *but*, *not only*, *more important*, *in fact*, *for example*.

**Description** deals with perceptions, most commonly, visual perceptions. Its central problem is to arrange what we see into a significant pattern. Unlike the logic of exposition, the patter is spatial: above/below, before/behind, right/left. etc

**Narration** is a series of related events -> a story. Its problem is twofold: to arrange the events in a sequence of time and to reveal their significance.

**Persuasion** seeks to alter how readers think or believe. It is usually about controversial topics and often appeals to reason in the form of argument, offering evidence or logical proof.
