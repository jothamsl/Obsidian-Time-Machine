## Choosing a Subject
When selecting a subject, it should be something that interests you and your readers, at least potentially. It should be within the range of your experience and skill

## About Readers
You don't want to repel readers. Don't suppose that it's the readers' job to follow you. It's your job to guide them, to make their task as easy as the subject allows.

## How?
Ask yourself questions about your readers: 
* What can I expect them to know and not know?
* What do they believe and value?
* How do I want to affect them by what I say?
* What attitudes and claims will meet with their approval?
* What will offend them?
* What objections may they have to my ideas, and
* How can I anticipate and counter those objections?

Readers my be annoyed if you overestimate their knowledge.
