## What is Displacement?
Displacement is change in position of a body in a specified direction. It is a [[Vector]] quantity and can be defined mathematically with the following equation:

$$Displacement=\Delta x=x_f - x_0$$

* $x_f$ refers to the value of the final position.
* $x_0$ refers to the value of the initial position.
* $\Delta x$ is the symbol used to represent displacement.

It is usually represented visually as an arrow that points from the initial position to the final position.
