## What is ADH?
ADH (Anti-diuretic hormone) is a hormone made by the *hypothalamus* in the brain and stored in the **pituitary gland**. it is also called *arginine vasopressin*.

## What is it's purpose/function?
It's an essential hormone which helps the kidneys manage the amount of water in the body. 

## What is it made up of?
Not Sure

## How does it fulfill it's purpose?
The hypothalamus sends a message to the pituitary gland which releases **ADH** into the blood stream. The ADH then arrives at the kidney and makes the kidney tubules more permeable(allowing liquids or gases to pass through it) to water, which increases the amount of water in the blood. As the level of water in the blood falls, [negative feedback](https://www.google.com/search?q=negative+feedback&oq=negative+feedback&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i271l2.3080j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) ensures that the amount of ADH rises.
