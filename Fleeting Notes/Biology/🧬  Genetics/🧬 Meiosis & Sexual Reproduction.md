# ðŸ§¬ Meiosis & Sexual Reproduction
created: 2021-07-24 13:40
* Sexual reproduction occurs through the production of a haploid cell (containing one set of chromosomes (23) or genetic material) by each parent.
* The fusion of the two haploid cells form a single, unique diploid cell with a complete set of chromosomes (two sets (46)) or genetic makeup.
* Haploid cells are produced through a process called **meiosis**.
* Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into an offspring unlike Asexual reproduction
* Variation is an important component of a species eveolutionary success.
* The vast majority of **eukaryotic** organisms employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce
* Cells divide to grow, replace other cells and reproduce asexually. [[Fleeting Notes/Biology/Cells]]
