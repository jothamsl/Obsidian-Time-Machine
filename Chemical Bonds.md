Chemical bonds form when electrons can be simultaneously close to two or more nuclei.

## Ionic Bonding
In this type of bonding which occurs when an electrons from an atom is transferred to another atom, in the process creating two [[_ion|ions]] which attract to each other due to the contrasting charges between them.

## Covalent Bonding
This is a type of bond that is formed when two atoms share the same pair of electrons. The stability of the bond comes from the shared [[_electrostatic attraction|electrostatic attraction]] between the two positively charged atomic nuclei and the shared, negatively charged electrons between them.
